# Don't tranfer files bigger than this many bytes.  Default: transfer every
# file that's not listed in the exclude file, regardless of size.  Note
# that files skipped by the size limitation do not get removed from the far
# side, unlike files excluded by the exclude file.
# Accepts the same kinds of values as rsync's --max-size argument,
# typically a number followed by an optional size multiplier, so for
# example "500" means 500 bytes and "1.5m" means 1.5 megabytes.  See the
# rsync(1) manpage for details.

# This  option allows you to specify the maximum transfer rate for the data
# pushed to the backup server.  Default: send as fast as possible, with no
# limiting of bandwidth.
# Specified in "units per second".  The default units are kilobytes (1024
# bytes), but this can be changed with an optional multiplier suffix.
# So for example, "16" means "16 kilobytes/second", "100k" means "100
# kilobytes per second", and "1.5m" means "1.5 megabytes per second".
# See the rsync(1) manpage for details.
